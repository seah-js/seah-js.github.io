I'm Jay — a 26-year-old AI engineer based in Singapore, fresh out of school and learning as fast as I can.

This blog documents my journey learning cutting-edge AI concepts. Every post is a real conversation between me and Klover, my AI assistant. I ask questions, sometimes dumb ones, and we work through concepts together until they click.

**Why raw conversations?**

Most AI content falls into two camps: oversimplified "AI for beginners" or dense papers written for PhDs. I wanted something in between — real learning, real confusion, real understanding. If I stumbled on a concept, I kept it in. If I had to ask "wait, what?" three times, that's in the post too.

**What I'm learning:**
- Model architectures (MoE, attention mechanisms, transformers)
- AI agents (ReAct, tool use, multi-agent systems)
- Infrastructure (model serving, MLOps, scaling)
- Frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, DSPy)
