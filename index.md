I'm Jay — a fresh grad AI engineer learning in public.

This blog is raw. Each post is a real conversation between me and my AI assistant, Klover. I ask questions, get confused, ask more questions, and eventually things click.

No polished tutorials. No pretending I already knew this. Just the actual learning process.

**Why this format?** Because the best way to understand something is to watch someone figure it out — including the wrong turns.

Topics I'm exploring:
- 🏗️ [Model Architecture](/architecture) — MoE, attention mechanisms, transformers
- 🤖 [Agents](/agents) — ReAct, tool use, agent loops
- ⚙️ [Infrastructure](/infra) — Serving, scaling, MLOps
- 🧰 [Frameworks](/frameworks) — LangChain, LlamaIndex, DSPy
